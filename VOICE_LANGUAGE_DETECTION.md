# Voice Interface Language Detection

## Overview
The VoiceInterface component has been enhanced to support automatic language detection while maintaining Vietnamese responses as the default. Users can now speak in either Vietnamese or English, and the system will automatically detect the language and respond appropriately.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. VoiceInterface Component (`frontend/src/components/VoiceInterface/VoiceInterface.jsx`)
- **Added language detection state**: New `detectedLanguage` state to track the language detected by the backend
- **Dynamic UI language**: The interface now adapts its UI language based on the detected language from the backend response
- **Removed fixed language parameter**: The API call no longer passes a fixed language parameter, allowing the backend to auto-detect
- **Enhanced status display**: Added visual indicator when English is detected
- **Improved translations**: Uncommented and enhanced status text translations for both languages

#### 2. API Service (`frontend/src/services/api_voice.js`)
- **Optional language parameter**: Modified `voiceChat` method to make the language parameter optional
- **Conditional request body**: Only includes language in request if explicitly provided

### Backend Changes
The backend already supported automatic language detection and required no changes:
- **Language detection**: Uses `langdetect` library to automatically detect Vietnamese or English
- **Appropriate responses**: Responds in the detected language (Vietnamese or English)
- **Correct TTS voices**: Uses appropriate Edge TTS voices for each language
- **Language in response**: Returns the detected language in the API response

## How It Works

### 1. Speech Recognition
- The browser's speech recognition starts with Vietnamese (`vi-VN`) as the default
- Users can speak in either Vietnamese or English
- The speech is transcribed and sent to the backend

### 2. Language Detection
- Backend automatically detects the language of the input text
- If no language is explicitly provided, `detect_language()` function is called
- Supports Vietnamese (`vi`) and English (`en`) detection

### 3. Response Generation
- AI generates responses in the appropriate language based on detection
- Vietnamese input → Vietnamese response
- English input → English response

### 4. Text-to-Speech
- Uses appropriate voice for the detected language:
  - Vietnamese: `vi-VN-HoaiMyNeural`
  - English: `en-US-AriaNeural`

### 5. UI Updates
- Frontend receives the detected language in the API response
- UI language adapts to match the detected language
- Status messages and controls update accordingly

## Usage Examples

### Vietnamese Input
```
User: "Xin chào! Bạn có thể giới thiệu về du lịch Quảng Ninh không?"
Bot: "Xin chào! Quảng Ninh là một tỉnh ven biển xinh đẹp..." (in Vietnamese)
```

### English Input
```
User: "Hello! Can you tell me about tourism in Quang Ninh?"
Bot: "Hello! Quang Ninh is a beautiful coastal province..." (in English)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open the voice interface and try speaking in both languages

### Automated Testing
Run the voice API test script:
```bash
python test_voice_api.py
```

This script tests:
- Automatic language detection with Vietnamese text
- Automatic language detection with English text
- Explicit language parameter (backward compatibility)
- Health check endpoint

## Backward Compatibility
- The VoiceInterface component still accepts a `language` prop for initial UI language
- The API still accepts an explicit `language` parameter if needed
- Existing implementations will continue to work without changes

## Benefits
1. **Seamless multilingual support**: Users can switch between languages naturally
2. **Automatic detection**: No need for manual language selection
3. **Appropriate responses**: Always responds in the user's language
4. **Maintained Vietnamese default**: Preserves the original Vietnamese-first approach
5. **Enhanced user experience**: More intuitive and flexible voice interaction
